# GitHub Action to Update Manifest in `main` After a Release is Published

This GitHub Action updates the foundryvtt.com website with a new version of a package after a GitHub release is published.

This is to be used with the `foundry-release-action`, and runs after a release is published to copy the manifest into main with the latest version information.

## Install Instructions

Create a folder named `.github` at the root of your workflow, and inside that folder, create a `workflows` folder.

In the `workflows` folder, create a file named `foundry_manifest_update.yml` with this content:

```
name: Foundry Website Update

on:
  release:
    types:
      - published

jobs:
  update_foundry_website_post_release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Foundry Website Update
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          ref: main

      - name: Foundry Website Update
        id: foundry-website-update
        uses: foundryvtt-dcc/foundry-package-release-action@main
        with:
          actionToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          versionFileName: 'version.txt'
          manifestFileName: 'system.json'
          compatibilityMin: '12'
          compatibilityMax: '12'
          compatibilityVerified: '12'
          foundryToken: ${{ secrets.FOUNDRY_PACKAGE_RELEASE_TOKEN }}
          dryRun: false
```

For `versionFileName` you will enter `version.txt` depending on your project.
For `manifestFileName` you will enter `module.json` or `system.json` depending on your project.

For:
- `compatibilityMin`
- `compatibilityMax`
- `compatibilityVerified`

Those are the major release of Foundry that this package is compatible with (e.g. 11 or 12)

For `foundryToken` - the package release token that can be found on the package's page on the Foundry website:
`https://foundryvtt.com/packages/<MY-PACKAGE-SLUG>/edit`

It should be added as a GitHub secret to the repo running this action.

For `dryRun` - this is an indicator to the Foundry website that this is a dry run and not to actually update.

This action expects the slug of the GitHub repo to match the package name on the Foundry Website.

You should not need to change `token` or `actionToken` from the example above.
